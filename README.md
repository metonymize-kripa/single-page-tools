# single-page-tools
Single page html apps to accomplish text related tasks, leveraging open source tooling. 


## Concept
- We should be able to save an html file to disk and treat it like an executable.
- Using modern browser as OS and locally running LLM as AI.

## Minimal PDF2Text
- Uses Pdf.js

## Minimal PDF processing via local LLM
- [llamafile.ai](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart)
- Tested as of April 2024, with local mistral llm executed via "./mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q5_K_M.llamafile"
